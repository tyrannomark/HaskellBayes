This defines a list-like monad for representing probabilities. Resources include: the [hackage page](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/probability) for the module, a [paper](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~erwig/papers/PFP_JFP06.pdf) on the functional programming involved.

`$ cabal install probability`
